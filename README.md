# Type_localities_Bolivian_fishes
This is a list of type localities of all nominal taxa of fishes within the borders of Bolivia. Geographic coordinates are sourced from the literature or, if not available, georeferenced using a standardized procedure.

Many type specimens of Bolivian fish species have been deposited in foreign museum collections, are in bad state, or both. Topotypes would greatly facilitate taxonomic research of Bolivian fishes. A list of type localities is a critical first step to enable the collection of such topotypes.

# Methodology
I consider all nominal species (i.e. including synonymized names). For georeferencing, I follow Chapman AD & Wieczorek JR (2020). I include type localities with uncertain reference to Bolivia (e.g. 18th century descriptions of _Orestias_ species with 'Lake Titicaca' as type locality).

Type locality of _Apistogramma inconspicua_ Kullander 1983: The description of the type locality in the original description reads as follows: "Bolivia, depto. Santa Cruz, R. Paraguay system, small pool of the R. Candelaria, above bridge on road Carmen-Santa Rosa (16°00'S 61°40'W). 29 October 1977. Leg. J.-P. Gosse (sta. 24)". The coordinates are imprecise and point to a location about 26 km west-southwest of Santa Rosa and 56 km west-northwest of the assumed actual type locality. There is only one river that has a considerable discharge between the two villages of Carmen de Ruiz and Santa Rosa de la Roca, which is the río Paraguá (sometimes spelled río Paraguay). It crosses the road at a hamlet called San Antonio de Candelaria. Additional information on the locality can be found in Walschaerts (1987), who describes it as "Bolivie, département de Santa Cruz, petit pool du Rio Candelaria, 16°00'S-61°40'W, 29-X-1977, station 24". The same station number 24 of the expedition by J.-P. Gosse is also described as "Bolivie, département de Santa Cruz, petit pool du Rio Candelaria en aval du pont, route Carmen - Santa Rosa à Carmen, bassin du Rio Guaporé, 29-X-1977, station 24" as a sampling location of paratypes of _Cichlasoma boliviense_ (Walschaerts 1987). The last bit is interesting here: _á_ Carmen could be translated as _in_ or _near_ Carmen. The río Paraguá is indeed the first river that crosses the road from Carmen to Santa Rosa and it is only 4.3 km from Carmen (of a total of 43 km between the two villages). There is a small incongruence between the locality descriptions by Kullander and Walschaerts. While Kullander (1982) writes _above bridge_, Walschaerts (1987) states that the pool is _en aval du pont_ (downstream of the bridge). It is unclear whether this is a translation error or whether fish were collected in pools both above and below the bridge. There are additional notes in the article: "The type-locality is a very small river tributary to the Rio San Joaquín in the Rio Guaporé drainage system. It is not the better known Rio Candelaria close to the Brazilian border east of the Serrania de San Lorenzo, where there are also two villages called Carmen and Santa Rosa (common village names in Bolivia)". This statement seems incorrect. The río San Joaquín (also called río Negro) is indeed a tributory of rio Guaporé (via the río San Martín and río Blanco), but its tributaries do not cross the road between Carmen de Ruiz and Santa Rosa de la Roca. In summary, it seems likely that a small pool of the río Paraguá below the bridge at San Antonio de Candelaria is the actual type locality of _Apistogramma inconspicua_.

Kullander describes the type locality of _Cichlasoma boliviense_ as follows: "Bolivia, depto Santa Cruz, R. Guaporé system, R. Uruguaito, tributary of the R. Quizer, 13 km S San Xavier". This is slightly at odds with the writing of Walschaerts (1987), who spells the name of the river differently: "Bolivie, département de Santa Cruz, Rio Urugaita, bassin du Guaporé, affluent de la rivière Quizer". It is unclear to which river both authors refer to. There is indeed a río Uruguayito (again slightly different spelling) close to San Javier, but it crosses the road between Concepción and Santa Rosa de la Roca. It is also not a tributary of the río Quizer, but a tributary of the río Negro (also called río San Joaquín by some sources). The río Quizer itself crosses the road between San Javier and San Ramón about 11.5 km south of San Javier, before crossing the same road again at kilometer 27. The first crossing seems to be the most likely candidate for the type locality.

The type locality of _Apistogramma luelingi_ Kullander 1976 is located in a "Kleine Quebrada unterhalb Todos Santos (Bolivien)". Todos Santos is a hamlet about 4 km (as the crow flies) from Puerto Aurora at the río Chaparé. It is depicted in an maps in Kullander (1976) and Meinken (1969). It is unclear which quebrada is meant and whether 'unterhalb' (below) means 'to the south' or 'downstream' (río Chapare flows to the north). The hand-drawn map by the collector K.H. Lüling printed in the Kullander (1976) suggests it is to the south, but the more detailed map in Meinken (1969, also drawn by Lüling) indicates locations to the north (downstream) as 'unterhalb Todos Santos'.

The type locality description for _Apistogramma rubrolineata_ has an unconventional format of the coordinates. It literaly reads 11°20'083'' S, 67°44'576'' W, but the seconds should not exceed 59. It was likely a decimal error. 11°20'8.3''S and 67°44'57.6'' W points to a location in the forest a few meters from the vegetated river bank about 1.3 km upstream of Puerto Cardenas. 11°20.083''S and 67°44.576'' W points to a location that can easily reached by foot from Puerto Cardenas. "Der Typusfundort lag an einem lehmigen Steilufer mit ins Wasser wachsenden Büschen" matches this location.
