# Type_localities_Bolivian_fishes
This is a list of type localities of all nominal taxa of fishes within the borders of Bolivia. Geographic coordinates are sourced from the literature or, if not available, georeferenced using a standardized procedure.

Many type specimens of Bolivian fish species have been deposited in foreign museum collections, are in bad state, or both. Topotypes would greatly facilitate taxonomic research of Bolivian fishes. A list of type localities is a critical first step to enable the collection of such topotypes.

# Methodology
I consider all nominal species (i.e. including synonymized names). For georeferencing, I follow Chapman AD & Wieczorek JR (2020). I include type localities with uncertain reference to Bolivia (e.g. 18th century descriptions of _Orestias_ species with 'Lake Titicaca' as type locality).

# Results
Type locality of _Apistogramma inconspicua_ Kullander 1983: The description of the type locality in the original description reads as follows: "Bolivia, depto. Santa Cruz, R. Paraguay system, small pool of the R. Candelaria, above bridge on road Carmen-Santa Rosa (16°00'S 61°40'W)". The coordinates are inprecise. There is only one river that has a considerable discharge, which is the río Paraguá (sometimes spelled río Paraguay). It crosses the road between Carmen de Ruiz and San Antonio de Santa Rosa at a hamlet called San Antonio de Candelaria. While it is difficult to exclude other options (there are bridges leading over small streams further east towards Santa Rosa de la Roca), it seems not unlikely that the río Paraguá at the location San Antonio de Candelaria is the actual type locality. There are additional notes in the article: "The type-locality is a very small river tributary to the Rio San Joaquín in the Rio Guaporé drainage system. It is not the better known Rio Candelaria close to the Brazilian border east of the Serrania de San Lorenzo, where there are also two villages called Carmen and Santa Rosa (common village names in Bolivia)". This statement seems incorrect. The río San Joaquín (also called río Negro) is indeed a tributory of rio Guaporé (via the río San Martín and río Blanco), but its tributaries do not cross the road between Carmen de Ruiz and Santa Rosa de la Roca.
