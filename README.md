# Type_localities_Bolivian_fishes
This is a list of type localities of all nominal taxa of fishes within the borders of Bolivia. Geographic coordinates are sourced from the literature or, if not available, georeferenced using a standardized procedure.

Many type specimens of Bolivian fish species have been deposited in foreign museum collections, are in bad state, or both. Topotypes would greatly facilitate taxonomic research of Bolivian fishes. A list of type localities is a critical first step to enable the collection of such topotypes.

Progress: currently 57 % georeferenced (of > 200 type localities)

# Methodology
I consider all nominal species (i.e. including synonymized names). For georeferencing, I follow Chapman AD & Wieczorek JR (2020). I include type localities with uncertain reference to Bolivia (e.g. 18th century descriptions of _Orestias_ species with 'Lake Titicaca' as type locality).

# Results

## 1820's: Joseph Barclay Pentland

Collections were made by Joseph Barclay Pentland while he was British consul-general in Bolivia from 1836 to 1839. Specimens of one Trichomycterus and four Orestias species were sent or brought directly to Valenciennes, who  hastily announced the discovery (Valenciennes 1839a, 1839b) and published the species descriptions a few years later (Valenciennes 1846). It seems that no record was kept on the exact location and date of the collection of Trichomycterus barbatula (Bertin & Estève 1950a).  Syntype of O. humboldti is from Guaichu (Peru) (Bertin & Estève 1950b).

## 1840's: Hugh d'Algernon Weddell

The species described from Bolivia by Castelnau (1855b) were collected during the expedition of Francis de Castelnau in 1845. Weddell was a botanist and his account on his travels in Bolivia focus on plants (Weddell 1850). Weddell was in the (historical) province of Chiquitos from 29 August to 13 of October 1845 (Weddell 1850), a few weeks after Castelnau travelled across roughly the same area (Castelnau 1855a). Little information is provided by Castelnau, who worked with Weddell's fish collection and described the type localities of _Callichthys taiosh_, _Callichthys chiquitos_ and _Doras weddellii_ as "flaques d'eau, au milieu des marais desséchés de la province de Chiquitos" (Castelnau 1855b). Weddell describes in this 1850 book that he entered Bolivia from Mato Grosso (= Vila Bela de Santissima Trinidade) and took the southern route to reach Santa Cruz de la Sierra via San Miguel. Weddell's map suggests that he travelled from San Rafael to San Miguel and then further west in the direction of Santa Cruz, rather than back to San Rafael and then south to San José (Weddell 1850), a different route than Castelnau, who travelled from San Ignacio to Santa Cruz on the northern route via Conceptión and San Javier (Castelnau 1855a). This would suggest that made his collections of lowland fishes in an area which situated historically in the province of Chiquitos, but today belongs to the province of Velasco.

## 1850's: Lardner A. Gibbon

Curimatus leuciscus boliviae Eigenmann & Ogle 1907, Elopomorphus jordanii Gill 1878, Psectrogaster auratus Gill 1896; Eigenmann & Ogle (1907) give collection year (or year added to the collection) as 1852. Vari and Howe (1991) mention that all three specimen have a note in the collection ledgers stating they are from "Mamora R. Bolivia" (i.e. presumably from the río Mamoré).

## 1870's: James Orton

## 1890's: Luigi Balzan; Gustav Garlepp; Alfredo Borelli

Luigi Balzan died in Italy in September 1893 because of malaria (Perugia 1897) shortly after returning from his expedition to Bolivia (ca. 1891-1893). No travelling account is known.

_Crenicichla saxatilis_ var. _semicincta_ Steindachner 1892 was described based on specimens collected in "Bolivia, Provinz Yuracares, im oberen Chaparé bei Puerto de San Mateo" (Steindachner 1892). There is no geographic location that can be unabiguously identified as Puerto de San Mateo. San Mateo has been previously been identified as "Rio San Mateo where Todos Santos is situated" (Conover 1943), "in the tropical forested Andean foothills at 500-1000 m a.s.l.", and "near an old road, which in the late 1800s was one of the few passageways between the Bolivian highlands and the lowlands" (Duellmann & Köhler 2005), but these georeferencing attempts were unprecise. Yuracares is nowadays called Chapare and belongs to the department of Cochabamba. Puerto refers to a place where goods could be loaded on ships, meaning that the river should be navigable. Saint Matthew is the patron of custom officers and tax collectors and San Mateo is therefore not an unsual name choice for a port. The names "San Mateo", "Puerto San Mateo" or "Puerto de San Mateo" appear in the taxonomic literature as sampling localities for birds (e.g. Berlepsch 1901), arthropods (e.g. Simon 1892, Staudinger 1892, Hering 1925, Lourenço & Leguin 2011, Marsola & Brescovit 2018), reptiles (e.g. Avila-Pires 1995) and amphibians (e.g. Steindachner 1892). The collector of the holotype of _Saxatilia semicincta_ could not be identified directly based on a literature search, but it was very likely Gustav Garlepp. Birds have reportedly been collected by Garlepp in San Mateo in July and August 1891 (Berlepsch 1901). A specimen of _Kentropyx altamazonica_ Cope 1876 has been obtained by the Natural History Museum of Vienna from Otto Staudinger (Avila-Pires 1995), who is known to have received collections from Garlepp (Anonymous 'S.' 1900). Some arthropods from San Mateo have also been reported to have been collected by Garlepp (Simon 1892, Staudinger 1892, Lourenço & Leguin 2011). Berlepsch (1901), who corresponded with Garlepp, describes the location of San Mateo as "im heissen Flachlande am Ausläufer der Yungas von Cochabamba", "am Fusse der Anden", and "im heissen Tiefland der Yungas-Region". Staudinger, who also corresponded with Garlepp provides additional details: "San Mateo am Rio Juntas (Chaparé) in Bolivien (etwa 300 Meter hoch)" (Staudinger 1892). In conclusion, Puerto San Mateo is most likely located in the Chaparé province in the río Chaparé drainage at the foothills of the Andes at about 300 m a.s.l.. As such, it would lie in the vicinity of Villa Tunari. Villa Tunari is situated at the confluence of the río San Mateo and río Espiritu Santo, where they form the río Chaparé. There is a little hamlet just south of Villa Tunari that is called San Mateo, but there is no direct evidence that this hamlet is Garlepp's San Mateo. Historical attempts to find San Mateo incorrectly located it as "a few miles east of Totora" (Bond & Meyer de Schauensee 1942) near Kara Huasi about halfway between Santa Cruz (Niethammer 1953) and subsequently georeferenced it as 17.70°S, 64.70°W (Mlíkovský 2009) and 17°42’/64°47’ (Dirksen & De la Riva 1999). There is indeed a hamlet with the name San Mateo in that area and a river with the same name. But it is far from the Chaparé province, not at the foothills of the Andes, and the river is not a tributary of the río Chaparé. Instead, it flows into the río Sajta which itself merges with the río Ichilo at Puerto Villarroel. The erroneous georeferencing attempt by Marsola & Brescovit (2018; 16°19'40"S; 59°36'52"W) points to a different San Mateo in the Velasco province in the department of Santa Cruz.

Alfredo Borelli's expedition to the North-west of Argentina and the Bolivian Chaco took place in 1895-1896 (Nobili 1896). Salvadori (1897) mentions that Caiza in the Bolivian Chaco is not far from the Missions of Aguairenda and San Francisco ("Finalmente nel Chaco Boliviano il Borelli visitò Caiza e le non lontane Missioni di Aguairenda e di San Francisco"). Borelli was in Argentina in September 1895 (Campo Santo) and October (San Lorenzo) 1895. Borelli was in Aguairenda in November and in San Francisco in November and December 1895. Borelli was in Caiza in January to March 1896 (Salvadori 1897). He was back in Argentina (San Lorenzo) in May 1896. The sites where Alberto Borelli collected fishes during his journey to Bolivia have been georeferenced by Koerber and Terán (2021).

## 1900's: Georges de Créqui-Montfort & Eugène Sénéchal de la Grange (1903); John Diederich Haseman (1909)

Maurice Neveu-Lemaire of the de Créqui-Montfort and Sénéchal de la Grange expedition took systematic notes on location and time of his collections (Chevreux 1904). These notes can be found in Neveu-Lemaire (1906). The type locality of _O. agassizi_ var. _Crequii_, _O. agassizi_ var. _inornata_, _O. agassizi_ var. _Senechali_ and _O. agassizi_ var. _typica_ is the Lago Titicaca at Chilaya in Bolivia (for exact location (station 29) see Neveu-Lemaire (1906)). Additional type localities (syntypes) are Lago Poopo and río Pazña for _O. agassizi_ var. _inornata_, the lagune d'Acostan (Chili) for _O. agassizi_ var. _typica_ and Bay of Puno (Lago Titicaca, Peru) for _O. agassizi_ v. _Senechali_. The type locality of _O. neveui_ is slightly nord of the entrance of the strait separating the peninsula of Karapata and the island of Cumana on Lago Titicaca in Bolivia.

Additional information from Eigenmann (1911a): Creagrutus beni: Villa Bella, Bolivia, Rio Beni, into Rio Madeira OR Swamp back of Villa Bella; Phenacogaster: Villa Bella, Bolivia, Rio Beni, into Rio Madeira OR Swamp back of Villa Bella \
Stethaprion crenatum: San Joaquin, Bolivia. Lake one mile west of town (no collection number given in first description by Eigenmann (1916), but collection date could be matched (4 September 1909).
Entomocorus benjamini: San Joaquin, río Machupo (match could be made by collection date (5 September 1909).
Ageneiosus madeirensis: San Joaquin, río Machupo (match could be made by collection date (6 September 1909).
Platysilurus barbatus: São Antonio de Rio Madeira. Rio Madeira near São Antonio (match could be made by collection date (3 November 1909).
Gymnorhamphichthys hypostomus: no collection date given, unclear which water body at San Joaquín. However, Ellis 1913 notes September 5 as collection date of the holotype, which would mean that it had been collected in the río Machupo.
Cheirodon madeirae: San Joaquín, Bolivia. Lake one mile west of town (match could be made by collection date (4 September 1909).

Trichomycterus barbouri: Eigenmann (1911b) notes: "The specimens were obtained by Mr. Thomas Barbour at La Paz, Bolivia, from a person who had been prospecting along the Beni river."

The type of _Xenocara montana_ Regan 1904 were collected by John William Evans in Tumupasa (misspelled as Tumupara in the first description of the species). Memebers of the expedition spent several weeks in Tumupasa in December 1901 and again in January 1902 (Evans 1903).

## 1910's: Fassl

Steindachner (1915b) notes that the types of Pygidium fassli were collected by Fassl. Xenocara boliviana was collected at the same locality, presumably also by Fassl (unclear which one of the brothers, both collected at the río Songo (Fassl 1920 part II)). Anton Hermann Fassl was in Bolivia in 1912-1913 together with his brother Eduard Fassl, who continued collections until the start of the first world war (Taut 1923). A.H. Fassl spent 9 months at the río Songo in a valley without human settlements (Fassl 1920 part II). He was there with his brother Eduard, meaning that collections likely have happened in 1912-1914. A site where Fassl brothers collected Lepidoptera for two years was above the río Songo at 1200 m altitude (Fassl 1920 part III). The río Zongo (in contemporary province of Murillo) merges with the río Coroico at Alcoche.

## 1920's: Mulford expedition (Nathan E. Pearson)

The río Popoi is the type locality of several fish species collected during the Mulford expedition in 1921-1922. All specimens are from September 1921. The expedition left spent several weeks in Huachi before leaving for a five or six day journey to Rurrenabaque in the last days of September (Rusby 1922, White 1922). Pearson writes about the stay in Huachi: "In this locality a month was spent collecting up and down rivers, in side streams, cut-off streams, pools, and in the main river" (Pearson 1924). The village of Popoy is located about 6.5 km downstream of Huachi. There is a meandering river entering the the Alto río Beni about 2 km downstream of Popoy on the other side of the river. This is likely Pearson's río Popoi.

Ivon: White 1922 writes: "made a new base under the hospitable roof of the Suarez Brothers' finca at Rio Ivon" "about a week collecting along the Ivon River in a covered boat". About two weeks were spent at Cachuela Esperanza (White 1922).

## 1930's: Carriker expedition (Melbourne A. Carriker)

Todos Santos of the Carriker expedition: from 31 July 1937 - 13. August 1937. Some exploration to the neighbourhood, including crossing the river and following a trail 10 km to the río Chimoré (Carriker 1937). Todos Santos is different from Todos Santos viejo. Boca Chaparé is two days from Todos Santos. At Boca de Chaparé from 16 - 31 of August 1937. Several trips to the nearby location, including an oxbow lake 2 miles by boat and 1.5 miles by foot up the río Chimoré. Fish were wrapped on the 25th by Mike. Entry for August 28: "we went seining in river for fish, in the shallow around the big sand bars at mouth of river. Got quite a few species different from Todos Santos". 7 days of travel from Boca de Chapare to Todos Santos. Again in Todos Santos from 7-12 September.

Boca de Chaparé visited by the Carriker expedition in the 1930's is sometimes translated to "mouth of the Chaparé". This literal translation is correct, but unnecessary. Boca de Chaparé does not refer to the confluence between the río Mamorecillo and río Chaparé (the origin of the río Mamoré), but to the hamlet of Boca de Chaparé situated at the left side of this river mouth. The company stayed at this location for several weeks and also explored the lagoons in the area. Fishes have therefore may not only been collected in the main river, but also in smaller water bodies.

Entry fro Oct. 17. (Ele-Ele): "Mike stayed in to label + wrap birds + when Berto got in they both went seining in river."

## 1960's: Jean-Pierre Gosse

Type locality of _Apistogramma inconspicua_ Kullander 1983: The description of the type locality in the original description reads as follows: "Bolivia, depto. Santa Cruz, R. Paraguay system, small pool of the R. Candelaria, above bridge on road Carmen-Santa Rosa (16°00'S 61°40'W). 29 October 1977. Leg. J.-P. Gosse (sta. 24)". The coordinates are imprecise and point to a location about 26 km west-southwest of Santa Rosa and 56 km west-northwest of the assumed actual type locality. There is only one river that has a considerable discharge between the two villages of Carmen de Ruiz and Santa Rosa de la Roca, which is the río Paraguá (sometimes spelled río Paraguay). It crosses the road at a hamlet called San Antonio de Candelaria. Additional information on the locality can be found in Walschaerts (1987), who describes it as "Bolivie, département de Santa Cruz, petit pool du Rio Candelaria, 16°00'S-61°40'W, 29-X-1977, station 24". The same station number 24 of the expedition by J.-P. Gosse is also described as "Bolivie, département de Santa Cruz, petit pool du Rio Candelaria en aval du pont, route Carmen - Santa Rosa à Carmen, bassin du Rio Guaporé, 29-X-1977, station 24" as a sampling location of paratypes of _Cichlasoma boliviense_ (Walschaerts 1987). The last bit is interesting here: _á_ Carmen could be translated as _in_ or _near_ Carmen. The río Paraguá is indeed the first river that crosses the road from Carmen to Santa Rosa and it is only 4.3 km from Carmen (of a total of 43 km between the two villages). There is a small incongruence between the locality descriptions by Kullander and Walschaerts. While Kullander (1982) writes _above bridge_, Walschaerts (1987) states that the pool is _en aval du pont_ (downstream of the bridge). It is unclear whether this is a translation error or whether fish were collected in pools both above and below the bridge. There are additional notes in the article: "The type-locality is a very small river tributary to the Rio San Joaquín in the Rio Guaporé drainage system. It is not the better known Rio Candelaria close to the Brazilian border east of the Serrania de San Lorenzo, where there are also two villages called Carmen and Santa Rosa (common village names in Bolivia)". This statement seems incorrect. The río San Joaquín (also called río Negro) is indeed a tributory of rio Guaporé (via the río San Martín and río Blanco), but its tributaries do not cross the road between Carmen de Ruiz and Santa Rosa de la Roca. In summary, it seems likely that a small pool of the río Paraguá below the bridge at San Antonio de Candelaria is the actual type locality of _Apistogramma inconspicua_.

Kullander describes the type locality of _Cichlasoma boliviense_ as follows: "Bolivia, depto Santa Cruz, R. Guaporé system, R. Uruguaito, tributary of the R. Quizer, 13 km S San Xavier". This is slightly at odds with the writing of Walschaerts (1987), who spells the name of the river differently: "Bolivie, département de Santa Cruz, Rio Urugaita, bassin du Guaporé, affluent de la rivière Quizer". It is unclear to which river both authors refer to. There is indeed a río Uruguayito (again slightly different spelling) close to San Javier, but it crosses the road between Concepción and Santa Rosa de la Roca. It is also not a tributary of the río Quizer, but a tributary of the río Negro (also called río San Joaquín by some sources). The río Quizer itself crosses the road between San Javier and San Ramón about 11.5 km south of San Javier, before crossing the same road again at kilometer 27. The first crossing seems to be the most likely candidate for the type locality.

## 1970's: K.-H. Lüling

The type locality of _Apistogramma luelingi_ Kullander 1976 is located in a "Kleine Quebrada unterhalb Todos Santos (Bolivien)". Todos Santos is a hamlet about 4 km (as the crow flies) from Puerto Aurora at the río Chaparé. It is depicted in an maps in Kullander (1976) and Meinken (1969). It is unclear which quebrada is meant and whether 'unterhalb' (below) means 'to the south' or 'downstream' (río Chapare flows to the north). The hand-drawn map by the collector K.H. Lüling printed in the Kullander (1976) suggests it is to the south, but the more detailed map in Meinken (1969, also drawn by Lüling) indicates locations to the north (downstream) as 'unterhalb Todos Santos'.

## 1980's to present

The type locality description for _Apistogramma rubrolineata_ has an unconventional format of the coordinates. It literaly reads 11°20'083'' S, 67°44'576'' W, but the seconds should not exceed 59. It was likely a decimal error. 11°20'8.3''S and 67°44'57.6'' W points to a location in the forest a few meters from the vegetated river bank about 1.3 km upstream of Puerto Cardenas. 11°20.083''S and 67°44.576'' W points to a location that can easily reached by foot from Puerto Cardenas. "Der Typusfundort lag an einem lehmigen Steilufer mit ins Wasser wachsenden Büschen" matches this location.
