# Type_localities_Bolivian_fishes
This is a list of type localities of all nominal taxa of fishes within the borders of Bolivia. Geographic coordinates are sourced from the literature or, if not available, georeferenced using a standardized procedure.

Many type specimens of Bolivian fish species have been deposited in foreign museum collections, are in bad state, or both. Topotypes would greatly facilitate taxonomic research of Bolivian fishes. A list of type localities is a critical first step to enable the collection of such topotypes.

# Methodology
I consider all nominal species (i.e. including synonymized names). For georeferencing, I follow Chapman AD & Wieczorek JR (2020). I include type localities with uncertain reference to Bolivia (e.g. 18th century descriptions of _Orestias_ species with 'Lake Titicaca' as type locality).

# Results
Type locality of _Apistogramma inconspicua_ Kullander 1983: The description of the type locality in the original description reads as follows: "Bolivia, depto. Santa Cruz, R. Paraguay system, small pool of the R. Candelaria, above bridge on road Carmen-Santa Rosa (16°00'S 61°40'W). 29 October 1977. Leg. J.-P. Gosse (sta. 24)". The coordinates are imprecise and about 26 km west-southwest of Santa Rosa and 56 km west-northwest of the assumed actual type locality. There is only one river that has a considerable discharge between the two villages, which is the río Paraguá (sometimes spelled río Paraguay). It crosses the road between Carmen de Ruiz and San Antonio de Santa Rosa at a hamlet called San Antonio de Candelaria. Additional information can be found in Walvaerts (1987), who describes the locality as "Bolivie, département de Santa Cruz, petit pool du Rio Candelaria, 16°00'S-61°40'W, 29-X-1977, station 24". The same station number 24 of the expedition by J.-P. Gosse is also described as "Bolivie, département de Santa Cruz, petit pool du Rio Candelaria en aval du pont, route Carmen - Santa Rosa à Carmen, bassin du Rio Guaporé, 29-X-1977, station 24" as a sampling location of paratypes of _Cichlasoma boliviense_ (Walvaerts 1987). The last bit is interesting here: _á_ Carmen could be translated as _in_ or _near_ Carmen. The río Paraguá is indeed the first river that crosses the road from Carmen to Santa Rosa and it is only 4.3 km from Carmen (of a total of 43 km between the two villages). There is a small incongruence between the locality descriptions by Kullander and Walvaerts. While Kullander (1982) writes _above bridge_, Walvaerts (1987) states that the pool is _en aval du pont_ (downstream of the bridge). It is unclear whether this is a translation error or whether fish were collected in pools both above and below the bridge. There are additional notes in the article: "The type-locality is a very small river tributary to the Rio San Joaquín in the Rio Guaporé drainage system. It is not the better known Rio Candelaria close to the Brazilian border east of the Serrania de San Lorenzo, where there are also two villages called Carmen and Santa Rosa (common village names in Bolivia)". This statement seems incorrect. The río San Joaquín (also called río Negro) is indeed a tributory of rio Guaporé (via the río San Martín and río Blanco), but its tributaries do not cross the road between Carmen de Ruiz and Santa Rosa de la Roca. In summary, it seems likely that a small pool of the río Paraguá below the bridge at San Antonio de Candelaria is the actual type locality of _Apistogramma inconspicua_.
